#### Mod Overview:

BetterSynthesis is a mod designed specifically for Minecraft players, aiming to optimize and improve the crafting system of the vanilla game. By introducing new professions, new blocks, and new crafting recipes, BetterSynthesis provides players with a more convenient and enjoyable gaming experience.

#### New Features:

1. **New Profession Villager: Chef**
   * The Chef is a brand-new profession villager. By trading with the Chef, players can obtain various food-related items and resources. The Chef will also provide some unique cooking recipes, making your food preparation more diverse and interesting.
2. **New Profession Block: Stove**
   * The Stove is a brand-new block used for cooking and processing food. With the Stove, players can use new recipes to prepare delicious food, enhancing the diversity of food in the game.
3. **New Stove Recipe: Cooked Eggs**
   * In the Stove, players can cook raw eggs into cooked eggs, providing them with a new food option and increasing the playability of food items.

#### Crafting Optimization:

1. **Stair Crafting Optimization**
   * In the vanilla game, many players often make mistakes when crafting stairs, leading to material waste and inconvenience. BetterSynthesis has optimized this process, allowing you to craft a full block by combining two stairs. This functionality has been adapted for most stair types, but if you discover any missing stair types, please provide feedback so we can address it promptly.

The BetterSynthesis mod not only simplifies the crafting process but also enriches the game content by introducing new professions and blocks. We hope this mod enhances your Minecraft gaming experience, making your adventures more enjoyable and fun!
